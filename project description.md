# ðŸ’¡ Analysis Highlights

Firstly, let's look at the age factor:
From the following chart, we can conclude:
The core audience for accepting campaigns right now is between 31-70 years old. Those aged 23-30 and 71 and up accept at higher rates.
   

Looking at the relationship between having children and participating in campaigns: We can find that fewer kids = more likely to accept campaigns, and spend less money.

  

The level of education does not have a significant impact on participation in campaigns.
  
we analyzed marital status and found that married and single individuals are spending more money than widowed and divorced individuals. We should focus on this segment.
